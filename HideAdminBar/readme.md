# WordPress Admin Bar Control

# I created it with the help of Claude AI and ChatGPT

A simple WordPress solution to hide the admin bar on the frontend for logged-in users. This repository provides three different approaches depending on your specific needs.

## Overview

By default, WordPress displays an admin bar at the top of your website when users are logged in. While useful for quick access to admin functions, you might want to hide it to provide a cleaner frontend experience for your users.

## Installation

1. Access your WordPress theme's `functions.php` file via:
   - FTP/SFTP client
   - cPanel File Manager
   - WordPress admin dashboard (Appearance → Theme Editor)

2. Add one of the code snippets below to your `functions.php` file

3. Save the file

⚠️ **Important**: Always backup your website before making changes to theme files.

## Code Options

### Option 1: Hide Admin Bar for All Users (Recommended)

```php
// Hide admin bar on frontend for all logged-in users
function hide_admin_bar_from_frontend() {
    show_admin_bar(false);
}
add_action('after_setup_theme', 'hide_admin_bar_from_frontend');
```

**Use this when**: You want to completely hide the admin bar from the frontend for all logged-in users.

**Effect**: 
- ✅ Admin bar hidden on frontend for all users
- ✅ Admin bar still visible in WordPress dashboard
- ✅ Clean frontend experience

### Option 2: Hide Admin Bar for Non-Administrators

```php
// Hide admin bar on frontend for non-admin users
function hide_admin_bar_for_non_admins() {
    if (!current_user_can('administrator') && !is_admin()) {
        show_admin_bar(false);
    }
}
add_action('after_setup_theme', 'hide_admin_bar_for_non_admins');
```

**Use this when**: You want administrators to keep the admin bar while hiding it for other user roles (editors, authors, subscribers, etc.).

**Effect**:
- ✅ Admin bar visible for administrators on frontend
- ✅ Admin bar hidden for all other user roles on frontend
- ✅ Maintains quick admin access for site administrators

### Option 3: Hide Admin Bar for Users Without Management Permissions

```php
// Hide admin bar for everyone except administrators
function hide_admin_bar_except_admins() {
    if (!current_user_can('manage_options')) {
        show_admin_bar(false);
    }
}
add_action('after_setup_theme', 'hide_admin_bar_except_admins');
```

**Use this when**: You want to hide the admin bar for users who don't have the `manage_options` capability (typically only administrators have this).

**Effect**:
- ✅ Admin bar visible for users with `manage_options` capability
- ✅ Admin bar hidden for users without management permissions
- ✅ More capability-based approach than role-based

## User Roles and Capabilities Reference

| User Role | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Administrator | Hidden | Visible | Visible |
| Editor | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden |
| Author | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden |
| Contributor | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden |
| Subscriber | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden |

## Which Option Should I Choose?

- **Choose Option 1** if you want the cleanest frontend experience for all users
- **Choose Option 2** if you want administrators to have quick access to admin functions while browsing the frontend
- **Choose Option 3** if you have custom user roles and want to use capability-based permissions instead of role-based

## Troubleshooting

### The admin bar is still showing
- Clear any caching plugins
- Make sure you're testing while logged in as the appropriate user role
- Verify the code was added correctly to `functions.php`

### Getting a white screen or error
- Remove the added code immediately
- Check for syntax errors (missing semicolons, brackets, etc.)
- Ensure you're adding the code within the opening `<?php` tags

## Compatibility

- WordPress 4.0+
- Works with all themes
- Compatible with most plugins
- No additional dependencies required
